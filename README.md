# INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN:
## APPLICATION
- This Mars Rover assignment is written in JavaScript following object oriented and functional programming structure. 
- Node.js is used to execute the Javascript code on the server, outside of the browser. 
    - This means your machine will need to have node and npm installed.
    - To install, get the node.js LTS version from: https://nodejs.org/en/. npm gets installed along with node automatically.
    - If you have node already, great! All you need to do is extract the zip file and run "npm install" in the terminal (or cmd) to create the node_modules folder (in the root directory, where "package.json" is) to be able to execute the code and unit test (see below for test instructions).
    - To see the logged data run "npm run rover" in the terminal.
    - You will see the output for each rover and the given plateau coordinates of 5, 5 in the terminal. 

## UNIT TEST
- For unit testing, I chose Jest which is a JavaScript test framework running on Node.js.
    - Functions from the class Rover and index.js were used for testing, as an example of unit testing.
    - Find the written tests in "rover.test.js" and "parseInput.test.js" files.
    - To execute test, simply run "npm run test" in the terminal.

## THE CODE AND LOGIC
The solution is devised using 2 classes and a main file (index.js), which is the entry point of the application where code is executed.

1. class Mars
    - generateMars(): creates Mars grid, allows its x and y coordinates to be inputted e.g. (5,5) which represents the upper-right coordinates of the plateau. 
    - addRover(): sets up a map of rovers and updates the Mars grid with rover's position by invoking updateGrid().
    - start(): starts each rover one after the other by invoking runMission() sequentially. 

2. class Rover
    - setPath(): takes the given input data as commands and sets the path for rover.
    - runMission(): takes command as individual letters to determine the rover's action, by executing the approriate functions e.g "M" executes moveForward() and "L" executes turn().
    - moveForward(): this method advances the rover one step ahead from its current position. For example, if the roverâ€™s current direction is North and coordinates are (1,3), then the new coordinates of rover will be (1,4) along the y axis, going North.
    - turn(): method turns the rover 90 degrees to its left or right using a modulus of 4 e.g. The remainders start at 0 and increases by 1 each time, until the number reaches one less than the number we are dividing by. After that, the sequence repeats.

3. index.js
    - The main file that executes the code of the application. 
    - Imports modules of File System, class Mars and class Rover. 
    - var inputs = fs.readFileSync(): reads a file from the filesystem in sync (block until the file is read). It contains the input data via a text file (input.txt).
